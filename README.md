# Machine Learning Project 05: K-Means Clustering 🎯

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of my fifth Machine Learning university project. The focus of this project shifts to Unsupervised Learning, specifically designing and implementing the K-Means Clustering algorithm. This model is utilized to discover underlying patterns and group unlabelled data into distinct clusters.

## Project Details
The Jupyter Notebook (`ml-proj-05-kmeans.ipynb`) covers the complete mechanics of the K-Means algorithm. Unlike supervised models, this project involves grouping data points based on feature similarity without predefined labels. The workflow highlights the iterative process of initializing cluster centroids, assigning data points to the nearest cluster, and updating the centroids until convergence is achieved. 

## Key Features
* **Unsupervised Learning:** Grouping and analyzing datasets without target labels.
* **Centroid Initialization & Optimization:** Implementing the iterative process of updating cluster centers to minimize within-cluster variance.
* **Distance Calculation:** Utilizing mathematical distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance) to assign points to clusters.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Evaluating the optimal number of clusters (K), potentially utilizing techniques like the Elbow Method.

## Technologies Used
* **Python 3**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **NumPy & Pandas** (Data manipulation and mathematical operations)
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (Visualizing data points and cluster boundaries)
